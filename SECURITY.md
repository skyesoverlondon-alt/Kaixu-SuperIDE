# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch and active production deployment.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately.

- Security contact: `security@kaixu.app`
- Preferred report format: impact, reproduction steps, affected endpoint/file, suggested mitigation
- Do **not** open public GitHub issues for active vulnerabilities

You can also use disclosure details published at `/.well-known/security.txt`.

## Response Commitments

- Initial acknowledgement: within 2 business days
- Triage/severity assignment: within 5 business days
- Critical vulnerability mitigation target: within 24 hours

## Safe Harbor

Good-faith security research is supported. We ask that you:

- Avoid disrupting service availability
- Avoid accessing or modifying user data beyond what is necessary to prove the issue
- Give us reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure
