# Compliance Roadmap (SOC 2 / ISO 27001)

## Company context

Skyes Over London currently operates kAIxU Super IDE with a single-founder model. This roadmap prioritizes high-evidence controls first, then formal attestation.

## Phase 1 — Foundation (0-60 days)

- Finalize governance policies in `docs/enterprise/`
- Standardize evidence logging folders and cadence
- Enable and verify MFA across all critical providers
- Document incident response and DR drills

## Phase 2 — Control Operation (60-120 days)

- Run monthly access reviews and vulnerability logs
- Run at least one IR tabletop and one DR recovery drill
- Formalize change management and release evidence
- Prepare customer-facing trust summary and control matrix

## Phase 3 — External Validation (120-240 days)

- Engage independent penetration test provider
- Remediate findings and produce closure evidence
- Select SOC 2 auditor and begin readiness assessment
- Map controls to ISO 27001 Annex A where practical

## Phase 4 — Attestation Track (240+ days)

- Enter SOC 2 Type I / Type II process (depending on buyer needs)
- Continue evidence collection during audit window
- Publish trust-center updates and procurement packet

## Success criteria

- Repeatable evidence for security operations
- Independent validation artifacts (pentest + audit)
- Reduced procurement cycle time for enterprise buyers
