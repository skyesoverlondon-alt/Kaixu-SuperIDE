# Vulnerability Management Policy

## Sources of vulnerability detection

- CI dependency audit (`npm audit --audit-level=high`)
- Code review during normal development
- Security reports via `.well-known/security.txt`
- Platform/provider advisories (Netlify, Neon, Stripe, dependencies)

## SLA targets

- Critical: fix or mitigate within 24 hours
- High: fix or mitigate within 7 calendar days
- Medium: fix within 30 calendar days
- Low: fix in normal backlog cycle

## Triage process

1. Validate report authenticity and impact
2. Assign severity
3. Record issue with remediation plan
4. Patch and deploy via CI pipeline
5. Verify with tests and targeted checks
6. Close with summary and evidence

## Exception process

Temporary exception requires:

- Written justification
- Expiration date
- Compensating control
- Re-review date

## Evidence log

- Store remediation records in `docs/enterprise/evidence/vuln-remediation/`.
